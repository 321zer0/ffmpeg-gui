The general guideline is to use the slowest preset that you have patience for. Current presets in descending order of speed are: 
ultrafast,superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo. The default preset is medium

Another optional setting is -profile:v which will limit the output to a specific H.264 profile. 
This can generally be omitted unless the target device only supports a certain profile (see Compatibility). 
Current profiles include: baseline, main, high, high10, high422, high444. 
Note that usage of -profile:v is incompatible with lossless encoding.

use -framerate instead of -r (-r 25 or -r ntsc or -r pal)
