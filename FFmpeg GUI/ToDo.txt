Allow user to specifiy encoder settings
Allow user to use crf values

Enable 5.1 to stereo option only if audio track is 5.1
Implement stereo to mono feature
Option to exclude & transcode secondary audio streams

Probe Subtitle streams and store them in SubtitleStream class

The general guideline is to use the slowest preset that you have patience for. Current presets in descending order of speed are: 
ultrafast,superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow, placebo. The default preset is medium

Another optional setting is -profile:v which will limit the output to a specific H.264 profile. 
This can generally be omitted unless the target device only supports a certain profile (see Compatibility). 
Current profiles include: baseline, main, high, high10, high422, high444. 
Note that usage of -profile:v is incompatible with lossless encoding.

use -framerate instead of -r (-r 25 or -r ntsc or -r pal)
